# NeovimConfig
My Neovim configure in Macos

Thank you! you watching my config of neovim, I'm so happy, you can watch my neovimconfig to be well!

I use packer.nvim to manage my plug-ins. This plug-in is very good and can be lazy to load plug-ins

I switch vimscript to lua,So I don't use vimplug to manage my plugins,But it's a good plug-in manager.
